 It's recommended to start by reading over the notes included in each section of the Prework Study Guide before utilizing it. If you don't know where to start, try utilizing the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I on a Mac or Control+Shift+I on a Windows keyboard. This will display a console panel that will show up either beneath or next to the webpage you're now reading in your browser. You can then view a summary of the prework subjects I covered, along with advice on which one to explore in depth first. You will receive some direction on how to move forward in this manner, and you can start your studies with confidence.
